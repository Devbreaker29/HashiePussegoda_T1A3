Travel App for Ruby Terminal Assignment

## Software Development Plan

### Purpose and Scope of Application

This is a Travel App which will match people to tours of their interest in Sri Lanka. The App starts by asking them what tour they would like and then appealing to a range of interests, then giving the tours, asking for a tour selection and then printing the tour summary.

The following app will solve a much needed problem which is matching travellers with niche tours that cater to their interests in Sri Lanka. 

Customers can read the tours available in the Travel App and choose a tour or tours and add a number of tours they want from each tour. Once they have done that they have an option to enter 'done' which will print their tour order summary with prices and totals.

### Features

#### Variables and Variable Scope
There are various classes in the terminal app which define the variables and ensure that the tests have been passed and the app is running. The classes are for the categories of Travel, Tours, TourItem and TourOrder and define the variables and provide indepth functioning for the app. These are known as variables and variable scope.

#### loops and conditional control structures
A loop was made in the Travel App under ruby_travel.rb. The purpose of the loop was to print a message "Would you like a tour? When you are finished type 'done'." and then enable the user to type done. This loop along with another loop which was an If statement was done to allow the user buy tours and otherwise type 'done when 'done'. The loops were made to conviniently make the user click done when making and order and enabled the user to order with convenience. This was called loops and conditional control structures.

#### write and utilise simple functions

The describe function is used to pass and write tests, this along with classes are very important in terms of passing tests. The describe function goes in depth of each test and goes in detail for each test and matches with classes to pass the test. This is write and utilise simple functions.

### User Interaction

#### How the user will find out how to interact with / use each feature

It is detailed in the README how to use and interact with each feature. When running ruby_travel.rb there are clear instructions on how to use this. The tests can be run using rspec gem and the terminal app cna be run byusing ruby ruby_travel.rb.

#### How the user will interact with / use each feature

The user will interact with each feature by running each test using the rspec gem. The way you navigate the terminal app is that you type the tour or tours you want and type done, then a price comes up. This is how to interact with each feature.

#### how errors will be handled by the application and displayed to the user

Errors will be handled in the sense that if the user doesn't type a relevant tour the price will not register. Apart from the terminal app there are no errors. Errors were handled by asking help and trying solve the problem so that the error could be fixed.

### Implementation Plan

Have to run tests using rspec.

Have to write tests for each class.

Need a file where you can run the file and the terminal app.

Need to run loops.

Need to run command line arguments and options to put input.

Need to make a script to run app.

Need tell people how to run my app.
